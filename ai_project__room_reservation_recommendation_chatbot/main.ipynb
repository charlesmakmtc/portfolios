    "**Introduction to the Room Reservation System Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python project is a **room availability checking system** designed to help users identify available time slots for room bookings in a hotel or facility setting. Built using modern AI \n",
    "and workflow management tools, the system integrates a PostgreSQL database, a large language model (LLM), and a structured workflow to provide seamless user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Components and Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Integration**  \n",
    "   - The system uses a PostgreSQL database to store and manage room status data. A `room_status` table tracks room availability, with entries for each room's name, start/end times, and \n",
    "status (e.g., \"booked\" or \"available\"). Sample data initializes the database with historical and future room bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LLM-Powered Workflow**  \n",
    "   - The project leverages **LangChain** and **Ollama** to integrate a large language model (e.g., Qwen3:14b) for natural language processing. This enables the system to understand user \n",
    "queries and generate human-friendly responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi Agents-Based Architecture**  \n",
    "   - **Room Checker Agent**: A specialized agent that uses a database tool (`tool__check_available_room_timeslots`) to query available room timeslots up to a specified target time. It \n",
    "extracts and processes datetime information from user input.\n",
    "   - **Receptionist Agent**: Acts as a supervisor, managing user interactions. It routes queries to the Room Checker Agent when needed, handles ambiguous or out-of-scope requests, and \n",
    "ensures professional, user-friendly responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Workflow Management with LangGraph**  \n",
    "   - The system uses **LangGraph** to define and compile a state machine workflow. This ensures structured communication between agents, with clear start and end points for processing user \n",
    "questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Interaction**  \n",
    "   - The project includes a `main()` function that demonstrates the system in action. For example, a user can ask, \"Can you check any available timeslots for a room on 2023-10-02 after \n",
    "1pm?\" The system processes the query, checks the database, and returns a list of available time slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases**  \n",
    "- **Availability Checks**: Users can inquire about room availability at specific times.  \n",
    "- **Ambiguous Queries**: The system gracefully handles unclear requests by redirecting to the appropriate agent or providing helpful guidance.  \n",
    "- **Error Handling**: If database queries fail or return no results, the system provides polite fallback responses (e.g., suggesting the user contact the front desk).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Output**  \n",
    "For the query *\"I would like to book a room on 2023-10-02 after 1pm, can you check any available timeslots for me?\"*, the system might respond with:  \n",
    "*\"Available timeslots: [2023-10-02 13:00, 2023-10-02 14:30]\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Matters**  \n",
    "This project exemplifies how AI-driven workflows can automate and enhance user interactions in real-world scenarios like hospitality management. By combining database queries, natural \n",
    "language understanding, and structured agent collaboration, it provides a scalable and intuitive solution for room availability checks.\n"

      "Okay, the user asked for room availability on 2023-10-02 after 1pm. The room_checker agent returned a timeslot at 10:00 AM on that date. But the user specifically wanted after 1pm, so there's a mismatch here.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to check if the timeslot provided by the room_checker is correct. The targeted_timeslot parameter was set to 13:00 (1pm), but the available timeslot is at 10:00 AM. That suggests that the room_checker might have returned timeslots up to the targeted time, but not after. However, the user wants times after 1pm, so there are no matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The room_checker's function is to check availability up to a specific time, not after. So if the user wants after 1pm, the tool might not have the capability to check that. The available timeslot at 10:00 AM is before the requested time, so it's not suitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the correct response is to inform the user that there are no available timeslots after 1pm on the requested date. However, I should mention the available timeslot before 1pm in case they're willing to adjust their plans. Also, I need to handle the error gracefully, as the room_checker didn't find any timeslots after the specified time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the response is clear and helpful, offering alternatives if possible. Since the user is looking to book a room, they might need to be informed that the available timeslot is earlier than requested, and perhaps suggest contacting the front desk for further assistance if they need a different time.\n",
