    "**Introduction to the Room Reservation System Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python project is a **room availability checking system** designed to help users identify available time slots for room bookings in a hotel or facility setting. Built using modern AI \n",
    "and workflow management tools, the system integrates a PostgreSQL database, a large language model (LLM), and a structured workflow to provide seamless user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Components and Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Integration**  \n",
    "   - The system uses a PostgreSQL database to store and manage room status data. A `room_status` table tracks room availability, with entries for each room's name, start/end times, and \n",
    "status (e.g., \"booked\" or \"available\"). Sample data initializes the database with historical and future room bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LLM-Powered Workflow**  \n",
    "   - The project leverages **LangChain** and **Ollama** to integrate a large language model (e.g., Qwen3:14b) for natural language processing. This enables the system to understand user \n",
    "queries and generate human-friendly responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi Agents-Based Architecture**  \n",
    "   - **Room Checker Agent**: A specialized agent that uses a database tool (`tool__check_available_room_timeslots`) to query available room timeslots up to a specified target time. It \n",
    "extracts and processes datetime information from user input.\n",
    "   - **Receptionist Agent**: Acts as a supervisor, managing user interactions. It routes queries to the Room Checker Agent when needed, handles ambiguous or out-of-scope requests, and \n",
    "ensures professional, user-friendly responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Workflow Management with LangGraph**  \n",
    "   - The system uses **LangGraph** to define and compile a state machine workflow. This ensures structured communication between agents, with clear start and end points for processing user \n",
    "questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Interaction**  \n",
    "   - The project includes a `main()` function that demonstrates the system in action. For example, a user can ask, \"Can you check any available timeslots for a room on 2023-10-02 after \n",
    "1pm?\" The system processes the query, checks the database, and returns a list of available time slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases**  \n",
    "- **Availability Checks**: Users can inquire about room availability at specific times.  \n",
    "- **Ambiguous Queries**: The system gracefully handles unclear requests by redirecting to the appropriate agent or providing helpful guidance.  \n",
    "- **Error Handling**: If database queries fail or return no results, the system provides polite fallback responses (e.g., suggesting the user contact the front desk).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Output**  \n",
    "For the query *\"I would like to book a room on 2023-10-02 after 1pm, can you check any available timeslots for me?\"*, the system might respond with:  \n",
    "*\"Available timeslots: [2023-10-02 13:00, 2023-10-02 14:30]\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Matters**  \n",
    "This project exemplifies how AI-driven workflows can automate and enhance user interactions in real-world scenarios like hospitality management. By combining database queries, natural \n",
    "language understanding, and structured agent collaboration, it provides a scalable and intuitive solution for room availability checks.\n"
